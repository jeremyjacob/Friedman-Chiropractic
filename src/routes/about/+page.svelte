				I have been in private practice since 1989. In April next year I will mark my 35th
				anniversary. I feel so blessed that I get to look forward to working every time I go to the
				office. I was an instructor at Cleveland Chiropractic College from 1990 to 1998. Teaching
				future chiropractors SOT adjusting techniques. I was a guest lecturer on several occasions.
				Part of my specialty education deals with management of the TMJ and cranial distortions.

				I am very proud of the fact that I can manipulate any joint in the body from the tip of the
				head to the tip of the toe. Over the past 25 years, I have collaborated with a Kabbalistic
				Rabbi. Together we have been able to find areas of overlap between Chiropractic and
				Kabbalah. This has resulted in a fruitful variety of techniques I have been able to
				incorporate in my practice. It has also given me a different lens for looking at the body
				and how to address different issues.
			</p>

			<p>
				My goal has always been to continue learning and getting new ways to do things better for my
				patients.
